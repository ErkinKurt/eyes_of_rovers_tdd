# eyes_of_rovers_tdd

Tutorial project for my team to get a long with TDD. It shows the basics of Dependency Inversion via Service Locator pattern called GetIt in flutter. In addition, injectable is used to register dependencies to GetIt via source generation. 

# Structure
Clean architecture is followed to create N-Layered architecture. 
Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation layers is shown. 

# Domain Validations
Not shown in the project right now but, the domain validations will be `Always Valid` approach. Which ensures that the entities that we are working on will be fully trusted.
